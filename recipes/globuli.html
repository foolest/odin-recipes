        Petronius, a Roman courtier in the first century CE, wrote that the students of his day â€œlearn nothing but
        "melitos verborum globulos et omnia dicta factaque quasi papavere et sesamo sparsa" which in English is
        "honey-sweetened round globs of words and all things said and done as if sprinkled with poppy seed and sesame
        seed". Apparently, this insult made perfect sense to Romans because students were familiar with the
        delicious fried food called globuli.
