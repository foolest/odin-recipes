    <p>
        Libum, according to Virgil, Ovid, Horace, and other Latin authors, was a ritual food prepared as an annual
        offering to the gods. There were many ways to prepare it. Virgil writes of a libum offered with milk to Priapus;
        Ovid of one prepared with millet for Vesta, of another eaten with honey for Liber. In the latter case, the
        author specifies that the libum is prepared by an old woman and split, still hot, between the faithful and the
        god, identified with Bacchus and considered the discoverer of honey and inventor of beekeeping.
