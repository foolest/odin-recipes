        Today we will present a recipe of isicia omentata. Omentum is the Latin word for caul fat, an ingredient widely
        used in historical and traditional Italian cuisine. It is essential for a good outcome of the recipe: Apicius, a
        roman chef, suggests using a lean cut of meat for the meatballs, and the omentum is the only fat used here. It
        will melt during the cooking, giving a pleasant moisture to the meatballs that otherwise would result too dry.
